# Getting Started with Vue.js

Vue.js is a **progressive JavaScript framework** used to build interactive user interfaces and single-page applications. It is designed to be incrementally adaptable, meaning you can use as little or as much of Vue as your project requires.

## Why Choose Vue.js?

Vue combines the best ideas from other frameworks like React and Angular:
- **Reactivity**: Automatically updates the DOM when data changes.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn, especially for beginners.
- **Component-based**: Build reusable and modular components.
- **Ecosystem**: Comes with tools like Vue Router and Pinia for state management.

## Installation

You can start with Vue in different ways:

### 1. Using CDN
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
<div id="app">{{ message }}</div>
<script>
  const { createApp } = Vue;
  createApp({
    data() {
      return { message: "Hello Vue!" }
    }
  }).mount("#app");
</script>
