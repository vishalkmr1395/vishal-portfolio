## Clarifying Questions and Assumptions 
            1. What is the age group of the older people? - 60+ years old 
            2. Why is this redesign required? Based on the goal, I could come up with specific pain points and design for the same - Goal is to increase engagement.
            3. Is there any demography we need to focus on - US  UK  India? - US for now
            4. The elderly people don't have any other difficulties such as hearing  speaking  seeing  mobility etc. - Nope. 
            5. Since majority of the elderly people aren't tech savvy - can we design this for Tablets / TVs? - Sure.


## Rephrased Question 
             Design a supermarket for the older people who are 60+ years old in the US in order to increase their engagement on Netflix

## Pain Points
            1. Discovery
            2. Sign-in 
            3. Browse
            4. Play

## Solutions
             1. Knowing where to get their product from - A kiosk that shows 
             the products in the supermarket and where to find them along
            with voice assistant  
             2. Taking a product from the shelf and putting it in the cart 
            - No product shelves should be over 5 feet. The person chooses what they want
            and it automatically dispenses the item in to the cart 
            that has a scanner that scans the product and 
            puts it in the cart automatically  
             3. Pushing the cart - The cart should be designed in such a way
            that drives itself based on the customer's movements and also doesn't block the aisle. The usability should be comfortable for the elderly people  
             4. Reading the labels - Voice assistant to read out the price 
             ingredients  expiry date  allergen info of the product  
             5. Finding parking spots - 80% of the spots reserved 
             for elders so that we can handle peak hour traffic  
             6. Checkout experience - Scan the products as they're placed
            into the cart and start billing  a voice assistant to keep them updated on the amount spent  
             7. Carrying the products to their car - The cart should be
            designed in such a way that it can be converted into a trolley 
            that can be used to carry the products to their car and also 
            has a seat for the elderly people to sit if they wait for 
            their family members to come and pick them up  

## Success Metrics
             1. Avg. number of customers visiting the supermarket (DoD  WoW  MoM)  
             2. Avg. number of transactions made per day/week/month  
             3. Avg. number queries responded by store managers per day/week/month -
            this would be a good indicator of how many customers are using the kiosk and the voice assistant  
             4. Avg. number of products sold per day/week/month  
            
## Conclusion
             To go ahead with the cart design  I would do a MVP 
             conduct some A/B tests and then go ahead with the 
             implementation of the extensive design
