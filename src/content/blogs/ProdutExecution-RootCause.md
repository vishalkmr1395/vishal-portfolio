## Clarifying Questions and Assumptions 
             1. Is this happening across any specific region? - `No  this is global`  
             2. Is this happening across any specific platform (iOS  Android)? - `Across all platforms`      
             3. You said the drop is 30% which looks significant given the scale of Instagram  is this a sudden
            drop or since when has this been happening? - `This is a sudden drop`    
             4. Is this happening to users using any specific feature (reels  stories  posts etc.) or 
             is this happening across all features ? - `This is happening across the product`  


## Possible directions to find the root cause 
            1. Technical - Dive into the recent changes on the product side and see what went wrong  
            2. Business - Dive into the changes in the business landscape  

## Technical
             1. Technical - I'd check on 4 factors and see how to proceed from here  
                 1.1 - Internal - Did we make any recent changes that are related to this? - `No`  
                 1.2 - Internal - Did any of our teams release changes that could be related to this? - `No`  
                 1.3 - External - Are we having any dependencies on external teams or libraries and
                 did they release any changes regarding this - `No`?  
                 1.4 - External - Are we seeing any anomalies in our ML algorithms - `No`?  
### Business
             1. Business - I'd check on 4 factors and see how to proceed from here  
                 1.1 - Do we have any Public Relations related issues / concerns ongoing among public- `No`  
                 1.2 - Do we have any reduction in the number of posts/reels from people- `Yes`  
                     1.2.1 - Do we have data on who these people are? `Most of the people seem to be influencers`.  
                     1.2.2 - Did we modify our user experience for the influencer journey? `No`  
                     1.2.3 - Did we announce any restrictions for the influencers? `Yes`  
                       1.2.3.1 - What did we do? - We reduced the commission we gave the influencers - `This could be one of the reasons`.   
                       1.2.3.2 - Having known about this  I would check if there's a correlation between the collaborators 
                       and their watch time on the app and take it from there.  
                 1.3 - Are we having any cybersecurity related issues - `No`?  
                 1.4 - Did our competitors change their monetizing strategy - `No`  
            
## Conclusion
                Since we have an idea on where the issue is (monetization related)  I'd check and understand on 
                why did we modify that and take it from there. Since our competitors 
                didn't change anything regarding their monetization  us reconsidering our pricing
                would be a good point to start and take it from there
