The NoSQL & AI Hype: Are We Always Using the Right Tool?

* AI is everywhereâ€”job roles, strategies, and countless posts. But do we always need it? Sometimes, a simple script can achieve what we try to solve with AI.

* This reminds me of the early NoSQL days, when people rushed to adopt NoSQL just because it was trending. But did they really need it? What about the trade-offs?

* We faced a similar challenge when we migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL because our data was inherently relational.

* One big concern? Data integrity. We had to retain uniqueness when moving MongoDBâ€™s 12-byte _id to PostgreSQLâ€™s 16-byte UUID. 

* The solution? Appending zeroesâ€”a simple engineering hack that preserved uniqueness and structure.

* Key Takeaway: Just like the NoSQL vs SQL debate, today AI is often adopted without first evaluating the actual need. By focusing on the use case first, we can avoid over-engineering. This reminds me of the design principle: [https://lnkd.in/gM6Qa8R2] Sometimes, simpler solutions work just as well.
