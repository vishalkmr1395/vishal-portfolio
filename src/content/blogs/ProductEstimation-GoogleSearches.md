## Clarifying Questions and Assumptions 
             1. Are we targetting any geography? - No  we are targetting globally  
             2. Is this including all google searches or any specific platform? - Everything  
             Based on the answers for the questions  I'd like to rephrase the question as - Find the number of Google searches made across platforms in a single day globally  

## Estimation breakdown  
             1. World population is 7.5 billion  
             2. People with access to internet is around 4.5 billion  
             3. Google Search is banned in China and the population of China is around 1.2 billion  
             4. This leaves with around 3.3 billion people who have access to Google Search  
             5. Out of this Google search has a market share of around 90% in the search engine market  hence the number of people using Google Search is around 3.3 billion * 0.9 = 2.97 billion people  
                       
                       
## User Segmentation  
             1. Lite users - People who use Google Search less than 5 times a day - 20% of 2.9 billion people = 600M  
             2. Standard users - People who use Google Search regularly between 5-10 times a day - 30% of 2.9 billion people = 900M
             3. Power users - People who use Google Search more than 10 times a day - 50% of 2.9 billion people = 1.5 billion  

## Wrapping up calculation  
             1. Lite users - 600M * 5 = 3 billion searches  
             2. Standard users - 900M * 7.5 = 6.7 billion searches  
             3. Power users - 1.50 billion * 15 = 11.250 billion searches  

            
## Conclusion
            Hence, the total number of Google searches in a day globally is around 20 billion searches.  
             20000000000/(24*60*60) ~=230k searches per second
