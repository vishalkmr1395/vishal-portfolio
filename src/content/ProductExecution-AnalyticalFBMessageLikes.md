## Clarifying Questions and Assumptions 
            1. Are we talking about the messages sent and received through Facebook website? - Yes
            2. Should we consider all platforms - Mobile, web? - Yes
            3. Are we also interested in the Seen part or only the Read part? - Only Read part.
            4. This is applicable to both individual and groups but I am considering only individual messages for this question. - Sure.


## Rephrased Question 
            Metrics to monitor the success of read receipts in Facebook messaging.  

## Goals
            To increase user engagement with the product, we launched this and would like to know if this is a success

## Action - User Journey
          1. Open the application -> Click on the messaging Icon -> Click on the messages from each sender 
          2. User can touch on the notification directly from their lock screen 
          3. FB also has a tiny widget that keeps floating through which the message can be accessed 

## Metrics
         1. Number of times the messaging icon was clicked per day
         2. Number of messages on which the user clicked per day
         3. Number of messages received per day
         4. Average time spent on messaging feature per day 

## Evaluate
         I would prioritize metrics 2 and 3 as this tells us if the feature is a success. Users are able to see the feature and this is helpful for their engagement with the application.
